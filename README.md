ATAC-sequencing
Experimental procedures: HS-5 LYNWT and LYNKO cells were cultured under normal
growth conditions. Cells were used to perform tagmentation and preparations for
ATAC-sequencing according to the manufacturer’s instructions of the used ATAC-kit
(Active Motif). DNA was isolated respectively and processed and sequenced with 50M
reads, PE100 per sample in the Cologne Center for Genomics following in-house
standards.

**Primary analysis:** The ATAC-seq dataset was analysed on the CHEOPS HPC cluster
of the University of Cologne using nf-core’s (v1.2.1)97 atac-seq pipeline98 
(nf-core/atacseq pipeline) in a Singularity99 environment and the corresponding workflow
management software Nextflow (v21.04.1)100 . Peaks were called using MACS2
(v2.2.7.1)101 with standard parameters (narrowPeak mode). Consensus peaks
generated by the nf-core/atac-seq pipeline were used for downstream analysis. Counts 
file of consensus peaks was generated using featureCounts (v2.0.1)77 with standard
parameters using nf-core/atac-seq.

**Differential accessibility analysis:** Peak annotation was performed using the
annotatePeak function of ChIPseeker (v1.30.3)102 with overlap = ”all”, Homo Sapiens
ensembl database version 104, and otherwise standard parameters. Differential
accessibility analysis was performed using DESeq2 (v1.34.0)103 with standard
parameters. Normalization of counts for visualization was performed using DESeq2
built-in variance stabilization transformation (vst method) with standard parameters.
Intervals with log2-FC >= 0.56 (Fold Change >= 1.5) and adjusted p-value <= 0.05 were
considered as significant for downstream analyses.

The **motif enrichment** was performed using the motif analysis tool of the python
package Regulatory Analysis Toolbox (RGT) (v0.13.2). In short, the tool implements a
simple Fischer’s exact test for each known human transcription factor from known
databases like Hocomoco104 and JASPAR105. Input region provided are all intervals
generated by ATAC-Seq primary analysis with log2-FC >= 0.56 (Fold Change >= 1.5)
and adjusted p-value <= 0.05 as computed by the differential accessibility analysis.
Background regions used are the universe of all called peaks. The fold change is
computed as ratio of foreground and background relative frequency, where a relative
frequency is defined as number of peaks with a motif match relative to number of peaks
without motif match. Motifs with 15% positive fold change and adjusted p-value <= 0.05
were considered as top significantly enriched motifs in LYNKO versus LYNWT.

The **footprinting analysis** was performed using the footprinting tool from RGT (v0.13.2)
in the atac-seq mode (See HINT-ATAC106). As input, we have used the sorted and
filtered bam files of merged replicates and corresponding narrowPeak files generated
by the nf-core/atac-seq pipeline (internally using macs2). We followed the standard
footprinting procedure to generate tracks as well as lists of motif-predicted binding sites
(mpbs) in bed format for both LYNKO and LYNWT conditions. Finally, we ran the
differential footprinting command of RGT to generate differential activity scores and
corresponding adjusted p-values for each motif.
